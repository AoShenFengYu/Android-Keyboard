#Build a New Virtual Keyboard Project 
Guideline on how to create a virtual keyboard or add more features to your applications. 

##1. Code
You may edit the sample project or use the code from the sample project in your own project. 

##2. Replace appkey
Replace the ‘nlptech_appkey’ in the project AndroidManifest.xml with your own appkey. If you do not have your own appkey, please contact zengine@nlptech.com for one and authorization. 

AndroidManifest.xml:
    
```
<application
    <meta-data
        android:name="nlptech_appkey"
        android:value="{appkey_value}" />
</application>
```


##3. Change the Package Name
You may edit the code in sample project, but you will need to change the package name.
