# Zengine SDK

## Introduction
Zengine SDK is a set of IME building blocks, providing complete support for emitting text. We support more than 100 languages, where most of them come with language model and dictionary, and we are still improving it.

With Zengine SDK, software keyboard developers can focus on business logic instead of tinkering various caveats in text input.


## Features
* Render keyboard layout
* Input by keys, including auto-completion, error-correction, and prediction
* Auto-capitalization on first word of sentence
* Input by sliding
* AI-powered next-word prediction
* Dynamic dictionary loading & download
* Emoji keyboard
* Theme support
* Callbacks for various input event. For example, when the user is typing Good Morning, you can get notified the typing action, so that you can recommend contents according to what the user is typing.
